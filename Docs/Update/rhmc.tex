\subsection{\label{sec:rhmc}\index{RHMC}The RHMC for staggered fermion}

From now on, we consider $N_f=2+1$. Two key quantities should be calculated.

$\bullet$ Calculate the action

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&\exp(-S)=\left(\det [D_{st}(m_{ud})]\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\det [D_{st}(m_s)]\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \exp (-S_G)\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The problem is how to evaluate $\left(\det [D]\right)^{\alpha}$.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:rationalapproximation}The \index{rational approximation}rational approximation and Remes algorithm}

The first thing to do is to find a rational approximation of a function, here we use \index{Remes algorithm}Remes algorithm as proposed by Ref.

The Remes algorithm is implemented in Mathematica, which finds
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&g(x)=c+\sum _i \frac{a_i}{x+b_i}\approx f(x),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
in an interval.
